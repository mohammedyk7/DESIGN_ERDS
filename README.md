# üè® Database Design Practice Projects

This repository contains multiple database modeling exercises, ERDs, and relational mappings for real-world scenarios including **Hotel Management**, **College Systems**, **Airline Reservations**, and **Company Operations**. These projects demonstrate how to convert system requirements into structured Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) and map them into normalized relational schemas.

##  Contents

###  HOTEL_MAPPING
Design of a hotel booking system including:
- Branches, Rooms, and Customers
- Multi-valued attributes like customer phones and emails
- Booking records, room allocations, and check-in staff tracking

###  COLLEGE & AIRPORT SYSTEM
Includes:
- College database managing faculty, students, exams, departments, and hostels
- Airport and airline reservation system handling flights, legs, reservations, and airplane types

###  COMPANY DATABASE
Covers:
- Employees, Departments, Projects, and Dependents
- Relationships like supervision, management, and employee work hours on projects

##  Technologies Used
- Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
- Relational Mapping & Normalization
- PDF documentation of schemas
- Concepts: Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, Composite Keys, Weak Entities, Multivalued & Derived Attributes

##  Key Learning Outcomes
- Design and normalize relational databases from real-world narratives
- Identify weak vs. strong entities and cardinality/participation constraints
- Build many-to-many relationship tables with attributes
- Differentiate between derived, multivalued, and composite attributes

##  Files Included
- `HOTEL_MAPPING.pdf`
- `College_Airport_Mapping.pdf`
- `Mapped_Erd_Practice.pdf`
- `ERD.pdf` (Guide with rules and explanations for ER modeling)

##  Suitable For
- Database design learners
- Academic project references
- SQL schema design practice
- Interview preparation for database modeling
